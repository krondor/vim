# Sync my vim config to a remote host specified. 
# Steps:
#   1. cd ~/configs/vim
#   2. git co portable
#   3. rsync -avz --delete -e ssh ~/configs/vim dc:~
#   4. ln -s vim/vim .vim
#   5. ln -s vim/.vimrc .vimrc

# Notes:
#   Using a git branch since some stuff I run locally won't be on remote hosts
#   This setups the files in a directory on the host called vim and then it
#       symlinks the .vimrc and vim directory to the user's home dir
#   This currently syncs the git stuff as well, at some point should probably do
#       some fancy export to a tmp dir and rsync those files over instead

# make sure we restore our local vim config to master
git checkout master


# @todo move the above into a shell function, setup a list of hosts, and loop
# through them to sync all hosts at once
